# PyVector
Very simple points and vectors (without error handling) on Python

Classes:

Point2
Vector2
Point3
Vector3

All classes have math and logic operations (+, -, *, /, //, **, &, |, ^)

Operation syntax:

Object (+=, -=, etc.) Other

(Object and Other must have one type (Point2 += Point2, Vector3 -= Vector3, etc.))
